Hello:

Thank you for agreeing to volunteer at the hackathon. 

We will be using Zoom breakout rooms during the event. Your main role will be monitoring the main Zoom room, the "lobby". During your session, the participants will be in breakout rooms. They may come back to the main room to ask questions or get help. Whatever guidance you can give them will be great. As a co-host, you will have to move them back into their breakout room.
We will also have mentors there to help the participants. They will need to be moved into breakout rooms so that they can help the participants. You should also keep a list of what groups have asked for a mentor to help them.

Since this is a virtual event we will be using slack and Zoom. You will probably have to set a few things up.
